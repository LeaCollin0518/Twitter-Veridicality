# Data

The data file(.csv) consists of two columns - the Tweet ID and the Veridicality Annotation. 


The annotations can be interpreted as follows
   
   
   
   * DY- Tweet indicates "definitely yes" towards an event happening (i.e., strong positive veridicality)
   
   
   
   * PY- Tweet indicates "probably yes" towards an event happening (i.e., positive veridicality)
   
   
   
   * ND- Tweet indicates "no desire" towards an event happening (i.e., neutral)
   
   
   
   * PN- Tweet indicates "probably no" towards an event happening (i.e., negative veridicality)
   
   
   
   * DN- Tweet indicates "definitely no" towards an event happening (i.e., strong negative veridicality)
